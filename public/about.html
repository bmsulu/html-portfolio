<p>Meet Sulaiman, ASP's junior front end developer. Despite not being at the company for too long, 
  Sulaiman has already become a key member of his team who is always happy and willing to help and go above and beyond for others around him. 
  He might be cool, calm and collected, but if you play him at chess you will find him to be an assassin. 
  As a big fan of Sufjan Stevens and the Cinematic Orchestra, 
  Sulaiman has free access to the office stereo.</p>
